SPICED ACADEMY DATA SCIENCE BOOTCAMP - week 5: "Dashboard" - Creating a dashboard using cloud database services. 

I used the well-known dataset of the fictive northwind company, which in my case was provided by Spiced Academy as a collection of .csv files. 

After a review of the .csv files I transfered the data to a postgres database and explored it while practicing SQL queries. After that I uploaded 
the database to an RDS Server. 

I created the dashboard with metabase, which I installed on a remote EC2 (Ubuntu) server.

The dashboard can be viewed as an animated gif because the cloud services aren't running anymore. 

I decided to focus on data regarding sales to german customers in 1997 to keep a good overview in my first go with databases. Even though the main focus for me
during the work on this project was more to practice SQL queries, interaction with cloud databases and databases in general and to create an appealing dashboard 
where the observations and related informations are easily accessible to the viewer.
