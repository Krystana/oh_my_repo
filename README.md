my projects



In this repository you can have a look at various projects I realised so far. 

I just started coding recently and attended the SPICED ACADEMY Data Science Bootcamp --> https://www.spiced-academy.com/en/program/data-science.

The code you can see here was produced in the context of the 12-weeks-bootcamp:

- week 4   -  text analysis: 

building models to predict the artist by a piece of text, using webscraping, HTML parsing, bag-of-words-method, Scikitlearn pipeline &
writing a command line interface for making predictions on that.
           
- time series analysis:
